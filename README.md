# automation solves poverty

the problem with poverty is that its profitable

if your business r&d ends with producing a list of tasks so you can subject humans to its repetition and spend the rest of your career constantly asking them if they completed it, you are in the way of human prosperity

dont say "i create jobs" when youre not bothering to automate the ones you pay minimum wage for

say "i create poverty" instead

and since youre not pushing prices down by r&ding and shipping automation, someone else is obligated to the rest of us to do it for you

#### middle term pain is coming

if youre a restaurant busser, and you appear at work one day to find a robot doing your job, be patient

the poor have more to gain from automation than the rich

treating your family to dinner at a cost of 20.00 is more empowering than you spending 1 hour earning 20.00, and not affording to dine out with your family until you work 4 more hours

you wont be alone

as seemingly complicated tasks riddled with industry jargon and social access requirements are automated, the white collar workers who mastered them to exploit the inefficient markets and proverty they create will be tempted to channel their clever sophistry at inciting anger and assigning blame

#### dont waste your time criticizing engineers for the economic consequences of automation

their priority is increasing the economys carrying capacity, and not colluding with you to protect your inefficient fraction of it

reacting with violence to the loss of your immediate opportunity to stay in poverty, or profit from it, is **not an option**

for most, learning is hard work

harming engineers and destroying the property they build will be treated as a tantrum carried out by someone who:
1. entitles themself to keep everyone stuck in a poverty loop,
2. refuses to accept the consequences of not laboring for a physical science education, and
3. destroys private property

if youre not interested in joining the movement to **automate** work, then you can at least help limit its consequences by learning and teaching others the basics of human sustainability

learn water, agriculture and electricity to sustain yourself and your community while the economy refactors itself from monolith suppliers indulged by government collusion and "banking"

if you no longer have access to the internet, gas and processed food when youre used to listening to streaming music while driving to the store to pick up potato chips, quietly planting and harvesting potatoes at home for a while is *not* the end of the world

its a peaceful beginning

industry and prosperity will return, and at an unprecedented capacity

be patient and help
